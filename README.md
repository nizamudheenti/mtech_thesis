## Mini Project 
### HATE SPEECH DETECTION IN MEMES USING MULTIMODEL DEEP LEARNING
Detection of hate speech from multi modal data is major issue for the single model deep
learning algorithms,especially from social media memes.Memes contains both text and
image data.when detecting hate speech in meme uni model will struggle and only multi
model can help.
In this project we tries to solve facebook challenge (Kiela et al.,2020),which is aims
to solve detection of hate speech in memes multimodel deep learning.We used a con-
catenation model which concatenates text features and images feature from Text model
and Image model respectively.And we applied hyper parameter tuning for getting best
parameters for proposed concatenation model.
