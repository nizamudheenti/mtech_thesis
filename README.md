### HATE SPEECH DETECTION IN MEMES USING MULTIMODEL DEEP LEARNING

Detection of hate speech from multi modal data is major issue for the single model deep
learning algorithms,especially from social media memes.Memes contains both text and
image data.when detecting hate speech in meme uni model will struggle and only multi
model can help.

In this project we tries to solve facebook challenge (Kiela et al.,2020),which is aims
to solve detection of hate speech in memes multimodel deep learning.We used a con-
catenation model which concatenates text features and images feature from Text model
and Image model respectively.And we applied hyper parameter tuning for getting best
parameters for proposed concatenation model.

## Main Thesis
### ABSTRACTIVE TEXT SUMMARIZATION USING TRANSFORMER MODELS

There is a significant growth of textual data in digital form in todayâ€™s technology period,
and it is constantly multiplying. Using efficient systems is required when dealing with
large amounts of textual data. This problem can solve by using automatic summarization
systems. As a result, working on the architecture of existing automatic summarization
systems and innovating them to make them capable of fulfilling the importance of
constantly rising data based on user needs becomes increasingly important.

This project aims to develop an efficient automatic text summarization system using
recent attention-based transformer models. The pre-trained transformer models PEGASUS,
BART and T5 are used to implement the automatic abstractive text summarization
system. The pre-trained models are fine-tuned using CNN/DailyMail dataset. Before
that, the dataset was preprocessed and tokenised accordingly. The automatic abstractive
text summarization model performance is evaluated using the ROUGE measure.
This study mainly focused on the hyperparameter tuning of these models. For that, the
number of epochs, learning rate and batch size of the model are used. The results are
studied.
